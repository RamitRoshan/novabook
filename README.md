# 🚀 NovaBook


NovaBook is a modern, Apple-inspired interactive product landing page built using React, Vite, and GSAP.
The project focuses on smooth scroll-based animations, premium UI design, and high-performance rendering to deliver an immersive product showcase experience.




### Installations:

```
npm install zustand clsx 
```
(clasx is used for some dynamic styling with tailwind css)


**To Display, something in 3D, we have to install packages(Threejs) that help us do just that. and we will take help of another library `@react-three/drei` , which will make it easier to work with Three.js within a react environment, which is composed of these UI components.**

```
npm install three @react-three/drei @react-three/fiber
```


## PS D:\novabook\public\models> npx gltfjsx macbook-14.glb -T

This command will convert the MacBook 14 Glb file into React Component and the `-T` flag will flatten the transformation.
